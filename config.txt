I am the greatest deVops engineer in town. The base guitarist that has ever lived. 
I will have my AWS Certified Associate qualification. 
I recently has a job offer of £1000 per day. 
I realised how blessed I was for how far the Lord had brought me.  
I make £150,000 a year a cloud/deVops engineer 
This is marvelous in the sight of God
